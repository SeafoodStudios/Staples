# Staples
Staples is a esoteric language that consists of four characters. This language is built on top of Python, and obfuscates it. Its syntax is binary text, except the hard bracket is zero and the curly bracket is one (facing right). Also, a checksum is required. This is done by copying the the code, reversing it, and making it the opposite bracket (facing left).

## Quickstart
Staples can be installed using this command:
```
pip3 install staples_lang
```

Staples can be used using a variety of self-explanatory commands:
```
staples runfile <file_path>
```
```
staples compilefile <file_path>
```
```
staples runstring <staples_code_as_a_string>
```
```
staples compilestring <python_code_as_a_string>
```
In case you don't understand, running the file runs Staples code and compiling converts Python to Staples.
